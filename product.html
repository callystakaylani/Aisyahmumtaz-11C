    <h2>The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath</h2>
    <p class="price">Rp.258.000</p>
    <p class="Description">
    The Bell Jar is the only novel by American writer Sylvia Plath, first published in 1963 under a pseudonym.
    Set in the 1950s, the story follows Esther Greenwood, a young woman who wins a summer internship at a New York magazine but soon finds herself struggling with her sense of identity, 
    societal expectations, and emotional balance. Feeling increasingly disconnected from the world and pressured by rigid norms about what her life should be, Esther slips into a challenging period of anxiety and deep emotional struggle. 
    The title metaphor—the “bell jar”—symbolizes the feeling of being trapped under an invisible barrier, observing life while being unable to fully participate in it.
    The novel is both introspective and literary, exploring themes of identity, freedom, pressure, and self-understanding through Esther’s voice. It remains an influential work in modern literature for its honest portrayal of a young person questioning her place in the world.</p>

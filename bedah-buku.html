    <p>
        No Longer Human by Osamu Dazai is a semi-autobiographical novel that tells the story of Ōba Yōzō, 
        a man who feels deeply disconnected from society and struggles to understand himself and others.
         Through a series of personal notebooks, the novel shows how Yōzō hides his true feelings behind humor while internally feeling isolated and misunderstood.
          The story explores themes of identity, alienation, and the difficulty of human connection, 
          focusing more on emotional experience than on action. What makes the novel powerful is its honest and reflective narrative style, 
          which allows readers to closely follow the character’s inner thoughts.
         Overall, No Longer Human is a thoughtful and introspective book that invites readers to reflect on what it means to be human
          and how people cope with feeling different or unseen.

    <blockquote>
       <em>“I had always lived in shame.”</em>
         — Osamu Dazai, No Longer Human
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        This quote reflects the main emotional core of <i>No Longer Human</i>, 
        showing how the narrator’s life is shaped by constant self-doubt and a deep sense of inadequacy. 
        The feeling of “shame” is not caused by a single mistake, but by his ongoing belief that he is fundamentally different from other people. 
        It explains why he hides behind humor and false appearances, fearing rejection if others see his true self. Through this, Osamu Dazai illustrates how internal struggles can quietly control a person’s identity and relationships,
         making the character feel isolated even when surrounded by others.
    </p>
    <p>
       This book is recommended for readers who enjoy psychological and introspective literature, 
       especially those interested in themes of identity, loneliness, and human emotion. 
       <em>No Longer Human</em> is well suited for mature readers 
       who like reflective stories that focus on inner thoughts rather than fast-paced action. 
       It is also a meaningful read for students or readers who want to understand how literature can express complex emotional experiences in a subtle and thoughtful way.

    <h2>Book Review: Crime and Punishment</h2>
    <p class="penulis">Written by: Fyodor Dostoyevsky</p>
    <img src="Images/Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.jpg" alt="sampul crime and Punishment" class="sampul">
    <p>
       Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky is a psychological novel that explores morality, guilt, and the complexity of the human conscience.
        The story follows Rodion Raskolnikov, a poor former student who commits a crime believing that certain individuals have the right to act beyond moral law. 
        As the novel progresses, the focus shifts from the crime itself to Raskolnikov’s inner turmoil, where guilt, fear, and moral conflict slowly consume him.
         Dostoevsky uses deep psychological insight and philosophical dialogue to examine ideas of justice, redemption, and responsibility.
        Overall, Crime and Punishment is a powerful and thought-provoking novel that challenges readers to reflect on ethics, compassion, and the consequences of one’s actions.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
       <em>“Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence.”</em>
            — Fyodor Dostoevsky”
         
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        This quote highlights one of the central ideas of <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, 
        showing how intellectual pride and deep thinking can lead to inner suffering.
         Raskolnikov believes that his intelligence sets him apart from others, 
         yet this belief becomes the source of his psychological torment.
          Dostoevsky suggests that the more a person reflects on morality, responsibility, and existence, the heavier the emotional burden becomes. 
         Through this idea, the novel emphasizes that true understanding often comes with pain, and that suffering can be a path toward moral awareness and redemption.

    </p>
    <p>
       This book is recommended for readers who enjoy deep psychological and philosophical literature,
        especially those interested in themes of morality, guilt, and human conscience. 
        Crime and Punishment is suitable for mature readers who like slow-paced stories that focus on inner conflict rather than action.
        It is also highly recommended for students and readers who want to explore classic literature that challenges ethical thinking 
        and encourages reflection on responsibility, 
        empathy, and personal redemption.</p>
